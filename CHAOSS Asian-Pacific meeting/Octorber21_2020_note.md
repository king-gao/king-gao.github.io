       King Gao: Map of CHAOSS Metrics 

       WG -> focus areas -> metrics in a really visual way 

       Action Item King Gao: will share the PDF in the CHAOSS mailing list 

       CHAOSScon China 

       Should we try to hold a virtual or hybrid CHAOSScon in China in 2021? 

       Maybe May or June between OSSummit China and NA.  

       Beijing and Shanghai is better than other city,and Shanghai maybe the best choice. 

       OSPO discussion: 

       Community risk assessment when contributing to OSS projects in upstream 

       Are there specific checkpoints we can follow / technical review documents, so we can assure the quality of the software project. 

       Is there a way this happens in open source? Can we monitor this quality in some other ways in CHAOSS? 

       Some references coming from the TODO group: https://todogroup.org/guides/ 

       With this respect, are there any specific discussions running in CHAOSS around the quality of the contributions? (e.g., size of the change review â€“ no more than 100 lines, recommendations in the size of the message, etc).  

       This may be worth exploring in the Evolution WG. 

       Open Issue discussion: Open branch lifecycle: https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/issues/368 

       What do we do with branches that are not needed anymore? 

       Question: How do we know if a branch is not needed anymore? 

       Can we have a metrics focused on telling us how many branches have not been active in the last X months? 

       List of those branches 

       How many branches have been opened for more than X days 

       How many branches have been merged and are still open upstream 

       This would be useful to know in order to clean the house, delete branches, etc. 

       Shall we look for a common roadmap? Shall we look for a list of measurements weâ€™re all interested? It would be good to have this roadmap so we can share this with others. And if needed open issues or so in specific working groups. 

       Some ideas: organization APAC chaosscon. 

       Some ideas: discuss about specific metrics, and then share those with the specific working group. This is the beginning of the conversations, and then theyâ€™re polished in the several working groups.
